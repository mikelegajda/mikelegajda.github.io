* 2019: Optimization algorithms for a real-life Container Loading Problem<br\>
_Supervisors: Prof. Renata Mansini (UniBS); Prof. David Pisinger (DTU); Dr. Alessio Trivella (ETH-Zurich)_<br\>
Study and design of different optimization approaches to solve a real \textbf{3D Container Loading Problem}. The solution I developed helped the company to increase amount of space used inside their containers during shipment and completely eliminate the risks related to bad load balance of the truck.
The solution I developed was accepted to be part of the __17th ESICUP international meeting__ on Cutting and Packing problems and in the meanwhile I'm working on a __scientific paper__ to publish together with the aforementioned supervisors.
